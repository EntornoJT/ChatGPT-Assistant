# ChassistantGPT

A **Chrome** browser extension that embeds ChatGPT as a hands-free voice assistant in the background. Any ChatGPT prompt is a quick "Hey girl" away!

ChassistantGPT **supports over 60 languages and dialects**. Pick your native language, and a **custom trigger phrase** (configurable in the tab). For example: who needs "Hey girl" when you can rock "Coucou Skynet" and converse with ChatGPT in French?
